Control Huawei R4830G2 / R4850G2 over CAN with ESP32

Wifi + bluetooth and multiple serial handling removed to simplify - so I could understand how things were working mainly.

This can be used as a general purpose CAN debugging tool too.. Or to set static PSU values. 

Basic understanding of addressing multiple rectifiers at the same time gained.
